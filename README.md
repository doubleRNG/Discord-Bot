# Discord-Bot

## Purpose

My love for both coding and playing games culminated into me imagining how I could help my guild members in a certain game have a more convenient experience with the multitude of events that occur throughout the day. This project is me just exploring the idea of a Discord Bot that handles greetings, notifications, and role management for the members of my guild's discord server.
